# SearchHotelsApp
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.3.


Vaidations
1. The search form has been provided with basic validations for text boxes.
2. There is a separate model class created to cast the data from the search form.

Suggestions for Enhancements
1. The app doesn't have a routing feature for now. It could be supplied with routes and could be split out in different pages to provide better accessibility.

2. There aren't any specific jsons for the internationalizations but the provisioning for the same has been done in the app. It would be good to seperate out the text into sepearte jsons.

3. Styling could be improved in the pages
